# About Me  
My real name is Luis Pacheco. I'm an architect graduated from La Salle Bajío in León Mexico with a Master in Robotics and Advanced Manufacturing from IAAC.
I been involved with DIY movement since 2011 when I figured out I hated building architectural models so instead I assembled a 3D printer to make them for me. This lead me to co-found [MakerMex](http://www.makermex.com) (2012) a digital manufacturing and robotics company with Sam and Juan Carlos. I been CEO of MakerMex since then.
